## Description

For this assignment, I had to create an employee directory with React. This assignment required me to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. Employee data was generated with the randomuser.me API. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:

- Sort the table by at least one category

- Filter the users by at least one property.

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
